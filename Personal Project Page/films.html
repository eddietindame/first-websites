                        You either love Arnie or you think he sucks. Some people love him <em>because</em> he sucks, but what's certain is that he left a massive mark on two decades of cinema and made a lasting impression on pop culture that is dwarfed only by his muscles. Total Recall is his best film not only because it contains some of the best one-liners and quotable scenes in his career, but also it's plot was reasonably clever (for an Arnie action film) and made you think about the ending.

                        <p><strong>The Legend of Drunken Master - 1994</strong>
                        <br><br>Not to be confused with the 1978 classic <em>The Drunken Master</em>, this film is also known as <em>The Drunken Master II</em>. Although not a direct sequel, Jackie Chan does portray the same character. This film is much more watchable than it's older counterpart due to the more fluid (and simply amazing) fight coreography and also that one stunt where Jackie actually falls onto a pile of burning hot coals. Yeah, Jackie did all his stunts for real. Often multiple times. Jackie is the best.

                    This was my first experience of a true epic Japanese Anime movie (Pok&eacute;mon doesn't count) and it left me in awe as a child to think that cartoons could be serious yet so mature. The magicians over at Studio Ghibli have a reputation for making outsanding pieces of animation and it's no wonder after seeing the likes of this film. Everything from the powerful story to the amazingly drawn art is near perfect and it's almost a rite of passage for anyone who wants to get into anime and see what it can really offer.                  </p>

                            Starring Dani Filth, the frontman of Gothic Extreme-Metal band Cradle of Filth, as "The Man", this low budget horror film is full of random weirdness gory practical effects. It pieces together four "screamplays" that follow several people connected to a deranged satanist child kiler and his son who is set on avenging those that incarcerated him and freeing him in the process. I like the atmosphere of this film and the semi-believable lives of the seperate victims of "The Man".

                        <p><strong>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - 2013</strong><br><br>
                        This film is on my list because I just watched it and the sequel last night and it's fresh in my memory. There are a lot of things I don't like about modern cinema, such as the over-usage of cgi. This film definitely over does it on that regard but when portraying a fantasy world like middle earth, it can be excused. While I'd love for every orc to be an actual person in a costume, that would be kind of ridiculous. The film would be nothing if it wasn't for the rich and interesting universe it takes place in and makers did a decent job pulling it off.
