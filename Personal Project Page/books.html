                        <p><strong>A Brief History of Time - Steven Hawking - 1988</strong><br><br> 
                            This is basically a book I read so that I could look and sound smart. Unfortunately I barely understood most of it and it's definitely something you need to read more than once to be able to talk about properly. Nevertheless if you want a 'simlified' version of the history of the universe (according to one man, mind you) then read this book. Meanwhile I'm actually quite sceptical of the existence of black holes and the gravitational model of the universe as explained by physicists such as Einstein and Hawking. The Electric Universe Theory is much more convincing.

                        <p><strong>Life After Death - Deepak Chopra - 2008</strong><br><br>
                            After reading this book I was certain that death is not the end of the road. Drawing from personal experiences and ancient Vedic philosphy, the book uses fictional storytelling and real-life accounts to present the reader with possibilities of what may await us in the afterlife. Chopra consideres the theory that death is an illusion of the senses and that the soul survives in an ongoing spiral of refinement, ending in enlightenment.

                        <p><strong>In Search of Schrodinger's Cat - John Gribbin - 1985</strong><br><br>
                            This book tells a factual and surprisingly interesting story of the development of modern physics into quantum mechanics. Gribbin introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory and delves into various experiemnts and discoveries that built up the modern world we now take for granted. For anyone confused or ignorant about this area of science, this book is a fundamental starting point that leaves behind the equations and tells a more human story.

                        <p><strong>Cycles of Time - Roger Penrose - 2010</strong><br><br>
                        This book contains a penetrating analysis of the Second Law of Thermodynaimcs - according to which 'entropy' (or the 'randomness') of our world is coninuously increasing and a thorough examination of the light-cone geometry of space-time. It cmobines these two central themes to show how the expected ultimate fate of our accelerating, expanding universe can virtually be reinterpreted as the 'Big Bang' of a new one.

                        <p><strong>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - 2005</strong><br><br>
                        This is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed these books immensly in my very early teens but this one in particular had a dark atmosphere and the best plot twists. It's a shame they messed up the film adaptation so badly as the world imagined by J.K.Rowling is one of the most imaginative and easiest to get lost in.
