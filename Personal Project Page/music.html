                        <p><strong>Children Of Bodom - Something Wild - 1994</strong><br><br>
                        I have considered this my faveorite album of all time for quite some time now. While nowadays I don't really have complete faveorites in music, I somewhat cling to that oppinion due to nostalgic reasons. This debut LP from the Finnish melodic death metal band enfuses neoclassical, gothic and black metal influences into their developing sound and it is one that I am very fond of. I'm a sucker for a bands early releases; they're always so juvenile and full of raw energy.

                        <p><strong>Totalit&auml;r - Sin Egen Motst&aring;ndare - 1994</strong><br><br>
                        Here's another album released on my year of birth! This Swedish hardcore punk band made me rethink everything I thought I knew about the genre (which wasn't much). This album gave me one of those moments of realisation when a whole style of music becomes understandable and opened up. I have no idea what any of the lyrics mean, but that's not too important to me. Everything I need to know is said by the non-stop punk-as-f**k drums, guitars and vocals so there's no need for me to look up translations.

                        <p><strong>Sleep - Dopesmoker - 2003</strong><br><br>
                            Dopesmoker consists of a single song. A single monolithic titan of sound that lasts for 01:03:24. This legendary album took the band from a respected sludge/stoner/doom band into gods that anyone after them would dream to be compared to. This album is an experience that changes the landscape of your mind into a mirage of sonic bliss. It shows that if something sounds good, then playing it over and over must sound <em>really</em> good. Also released in a six part album as <i>Jerusalem</i> in 1999, Dopesmoker is the definitive version of the Californian band's magnum opus.

                        <p><strong>Barbatos - Rocking Metal Motherfucker - 2003</strong><br><br>
                     This is the sound of a very drunk Japanese guy and some very fast music. Yasuyuki Suzuki, the self proclaimed mofo, started this band as a side project to his main band <i>Abigail</i> as a less serious speed-party-metal-punk outfit. The sound ended up so good that the line between <i>Abigail</i> and <i>Barbatos</i> became thinner and thinner. With song names like <i>Sexual Alcohol Metal</i> and my personal favorite <i>Dick Is Fucking Big</i>, It's clear that serious music is not this band's focus and I believe they produce better music because of it.

                        <p><strong>Galneryus = Advance to the Fall - 2005</strong><br><br>
                        This Japanese band is another one of my long-time favorites. Their neoclassical power-metal sound is held together with operatic vocals, catchy riffs and haunting melodies. Every member of the band (especially the guitarist Syu and keyboardist Yuhki) play at the highest level of skill and come together to form a very talented group. I was lucky enough to see them in Paris this summer on their first ever European tour. It was a moment I had only ever dreamed would happen.
