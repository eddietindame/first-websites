                        <p><strong>Guitar</strong><br><br>
                        I started playing the electric guitar around 9 years ago. I decided to start playing after seeing an episode of wife swap where a kid was learning to play and I thought it looked easy. I was wrong. Much practice got me some pretty decent skills for my age (at the time) but I got lazy and now I'm just average (in my opinion). I also dabble in bass and acoustic from time to time. I play mostly metal and punk stuff but lately I've been working on my finger picking and playing more classical tunes. I play the LTD MH-400 (pictured on the right).

                            Videogames are a pretty big part of my life. My first games console was a Nintendo 64. I've been a fan ever since. My current faveorite game series are <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> and <i>Street Fighter</i>. I've been enjoy the competetive scene in <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> and <i>Street Fighter</i> a lot lately. As there aren't that many people around me to play with (apart from online), I spend a lot of time watching competetive matches and tournaments on Youtube.

                        9/11 was an inside job. Ebola isn't going to kill us all and if it does, blame the people who created it. ISIS aren't going to kill us all and if they do, blame the CIA among other intelligence agencies around the globe for creating them. Fake beheadings are extremely easy to create and post online. Every major event takes the form of problem, reaction, solution. The whole world is a stage. The whole world is enslaved. Question everything. If we ever wish to break free from our shackles we must put knowledge above ignorance and love above fear. We never really die.

                        While not as die-hard as some, I do enjoy a good anime binge from time to time. There's nothing like getting lost in a new series on netflix. I've liked anime since I was young, starting with watching whatever was on Citv (Pokemon, Digimon, Cardcaptors, Flint the Time Detective etc). My faveorite anime that I recently watched is <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>. It had such great character development and pacing that I've never been attatched to a group of characters more, whether anime or otherwise. I highly recemond it to any fan of Japanese cartoons.

                        I'll be honest, I'm lazy, unmotivated and lack dedication. Martial arts are supposed to help with that kind of discipline but I still don't train any where near enough (haven't been training since before summer, yikes). I'm basically an on and off practitioner of whatever I feel like. Last year I was the president of UKC Kung Fu Club. I've also dabbled in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai. When not training (which is most of the time) I like watching Kung Fu films and MMA fights.
